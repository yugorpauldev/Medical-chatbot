Extensibility means that the muscle can be extended \\n(stretched) without damaging th e tissue.  Most skeletal \\nmuscles are arranged in opposing pairs.

Muscle tone is responsible for posture; for example, \\nkeeping the back and legs straight, the head held in upright \\nposition, and the abdomen from bulging.  \\n \\nMuscle attachments  \\nMost muscles extend from one bone to another and cross at \\nleast one movable joint.  Muscle contraction causes most \\nbody movements by pulling one of the bones towards the \\nother across the movable joint. Some muscles are not \\nattached to bone at both ends. For example, some facial \\nmuscles attach to the skin, which moves as the muscles \\ncontract.'),\n",

When this valve is open, blood flows freely from \\nthe right atrium into the right ventricle. However, when the \\nright ventricle begins to contract, the valve closes so that \\nblood cannot return to the right atrium; this ensures forward \\nflow into the pulmonary artery. \\n2.
